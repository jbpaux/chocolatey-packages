    <summary>The Bosh CLI is the command line tool used for interacting with all things BOSH, from deployment operations to software release management.</summary>
    <description>BOSH is a project that unifies release engineering, deployment, and lifecycle management of small and large-scale cloud software. 
    BOSH can provision and deploy software over hundreds of VMs. It also performs monitoring, failure recovery, and software updates with zero-to-minimal downtime.
    In addition, BOSH supports multiple Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers like VMware vSphere, Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services EC2, Microsoft Azure, and OpenStack. 
    There is a Cloud Provider Interface (CPI) that enables users to extend BOSH to support additional IaaS providers such as Apache CloudStack and VirtualBox.

    The Bosh CLI is the command line tool used for interacting with all things BOSH, from deployment operations to software release management.</description>
